Chat with PDF Web Application
Chat with PDF is a locally deployable web application designed to help businesses securely interact with PDF documents using advanced language models. This tool allows companies to run the application on their own infrastructure, ensuring that sensitive information remains secure and under their control.

Key Features
Local Deployment: Run the application entirely on-premise, keeping all document data secure within your company's infrastructure.
Advanced PDF Interaction: Users can query PDFs in natural language and receive contextual responses.
Embedding Model & Vector Database: Efficient document retrieval using vectorized representations of content for fast, accurate responses.
Augmented Queries: Leverages a language model (LLM) to augment user queries with relevant context from document embeddings for enhanced interaction.
Seamless Pre-processing: Automatically processes and chunks PDF documents, converting them into meaningful embeddings using state-of-the-art machine learning models.
Customizable & Extendable: The application is modular, allowing companies to integrate their own models, or extend functionality to meet specific needs.

Architecture Overview
The system is divided into three main stages:

Pre-processing:

User documents are processed, chunked, and embedded into vector representations using an Embedding Model.
Embeddings are stored in a Vector Database for fast retrieval.
Retrieval & Augmentation:

When a user submits a query, the Embedding Model retrieves the most relevant context from the vector database.
The system then augments the query with this context before passing it to the Language Model for response generation.
Generation:

The Language Model (LLM) processes the augmented query and generates a response based on both the user's input and the retrieved document content.

note for me:
include multiple data processing such as sql,excel
1.implementing access control methods probably//RBAC or PROJECT BASED
2.Admin dash board and tools
3.deploying it in VM
4.probably logger and intrusion detection systems
